## Flappy Bird Game in Unity

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Unity. The game is inspired by the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" and is built with Unity's 2D features.

### Gameplay

In this game, the player controls a bird that moves continuously to the right. The player can make the bird flap its wings to navigate through a series of pipes that appear on the screen. Each pipe has a gap, and the player must guide the bird through these gaps without colliding with the pipes or the ground. The game gets progressively more challenging as the player earns points by passing through the pipes.

### Scoring

The player earns points by collecting coins that are scattered throughout the game. The more coins collected, the higher the score. The challenge lies in balancing between avoiding obstacles and actively seeking out these coins.
